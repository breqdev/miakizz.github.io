<h1>Welcome to X11:11 make a fish!</h1>
To access this service, you will need an X11 server on your computer. This can be accomplished with any non-Wayland Linux machine, MacOS with "XQuartz" running, or Windows (somehow I'm sure). 

<ol>
<li>Enable X11 to accept TCP connections. On MacOS, that's accomplished by running "defaults write org.xquartz.X11 nolisten_tcp -boolean false" before starting XQuartz. Linux seems a little harder, <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1516260"> here might be a decent place to start</a></li>
<li>Make sure port 6000 on your machine is accessible to the internet, likely through port forwarding on your router. Ask someone who's setup a Minecraft server for help.</li>
<li>Run "xhost +" in an xterm. WARNING: this allows unauthenticated connections to your computer from the internet (though only display calls) and should NOT be left on. I tried something slightly more secure but couldn't get it to work :(</li>
<li>Enter your public IP address (available at <a href="https://ifconfig.me">sites like this</a>), and press Fish!</li>
